# CocoLinks-CocoSpace-CocoReader

###About CocoLinks
CocoLinks enables the user to save a set of links into the application that can be easily opened later. The app's ease of use comes from its ability to open a set of links without having to open a browser and navigate through a bookmark manager. There is also increased privacy due to the self contained nature of the app.

By using this App, the user can free up non-essential webpages, switch tasks, or work on multiple workflows while keeping the number of windows and tabs to a minimum.

CocoLinks comes with the option to choose between browsers, Chrome or Safari, and open links in an existing window or new window.

Additions to the app include a webpage count, next to each set of links, and also a tactical search button. The search button shows all the unique websites currently open in every window. This button is basically a temporary, floating bookmark tab.

###About CocoSpace

CocoSpace implements a project structure in order to help you segregate your work. Each project appears under the selected profile label as a specified profile name. Each project divides your saved urls into multiple contexts, each with their own workspace.  This arrangement enables you to switch between different projects and continue working from where you left off.

Creating a project is straightforward, find the dropdown menu, under the CocoLinks tab named Edit Profile and select New Profile and then follow the prompts. 

CocoSpace's CocoReader suite includes a tool to manage pdf files on the computer's file system.  Sometimes multiple pdf files are located in a directory and need to be accessed for a project. The table format easily allows the user to find and open multiple pdf files in the browser. The same options such as choosing between Safari and Chrome or opening a document in a New Window also applies to pdfs.

The Open, Save, and Delete buttons mainly correspond to managing url links in each profile. These buttons operate on the front most window of the “checked” web browser. There is an increase of control that comes with the "open in new window" option. Besides improved url management, this feature is incredibly useful when multiple Desktops Views are used because windows can be opened easily without dragging and dropping browser windows.

The Search button is less intuitive in that in operates on all the windows. It gets the "domain names", such as http://google.com, from all windows. Its useful for searching for a url thats already open, or the feature can be used as a "temporary bookmark.”

Another great way to use CocoSpace is to assign the app to all Desktops. Then, the "new window", Cmd-N, shortcut can be used to open a web browser window in a specific desktop.



####Example Usage
The Open, Save, and Delete button correspond to the opening web links from the profile. These buttons operate on the front most window of the “checked” web browser. There is an increase of control that comes with the "open in new window" option. Besides improved url management, this feature is increadibly useful when multiple Desktops Views because windows can be opened easily without the need to drag and drop windows.

The Search button operates on all the windows and gets the domain names, such as http://google.com. Its useful for searching for an open url.

On the upper right hand side, the current profile is shown in a drop down menu. New profiles can be created from Extras>Edit Profiles. This becomes useful many saved “link clusters” are in a single profile. 

The Export Links button is mostly for developers who want to export the saved links. I say developers because using the web links in a text format requires some knowledge of bash commands.

Finally, the Open PDF File is pretty useful when downloading multiple PDFs, or when PDF are scattered throughout the file system. Multiple PDFs could be open in a browser and then saved into a profile for ease of access.

###About CocoReader
CocoReader enables the user to view the pdf files in a folder in a list, and then allows the user to open any PDF file in that list with a browser of their choice. 

CocoReader comes with the option to choose between browsers, Chrome or Safari, and open links in an existing window or new window.

###System Requirements
CocoLinks work requires a Macintosh and a Mac OS X version 10.8 or later installed. CocoLinks profiles are located in the app’s container folder as it is required by Apple for distributed applications. CocoLinks supports Safari and Chrome.

The application is ready for use after downloading. Moving the CocoLinks to the dock allows for easy access to different profiles.
