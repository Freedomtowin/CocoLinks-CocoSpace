# CocoLinks-CocoSpace

###About CocoLinks
CocoLinks enables the user to save a set of links into the application that can be easily opened later. The app ease of use comes from its ability to open a set of links without having to open a browser and navigate through a bookmark manager. There is also increased privacy due to the self contained nature of the app.

By using this App, the user can free up non-essential webpages, switch tasks, or work on multiple workflows while keeping the number of windows and tabs to a minimum.

CocoLinks comes with the option to choose between browsers, Chrome or Safari, and open links in an existing window or new window.

Additions to the app include a webpage count, next to each set of links, and also a tactical search button. The search button shows all the unique websites currently open in every window. This button is basically a temporary, floating bookmark tab.

###About CocoSpace
CocoSpace is an upgraded version of CocoLinks which includes extended features that make it easier for developers or users with lots of saved links that need to be saved in different profiles or exported with different bash commands.

Each set of links can be exported in a file type with the appropriate bash commands. For windows, a .bat file can be exported with bash commands to auto-open the links using bash. A .sh file accomplishes the same task for mac. Finally, a .txt file can be exported with no bash commands.

Another extended feature for CocoSpace are commands to create, delete, and archive profile. These commands allow for links to be more organized in multiple profiles.

###System Requirements
CocoLinks work requires a Macintosh and a Mac OS X version 10.8 or later installed. CocoLinks profiles are located in the appâ€™s container folder as it is required by Apple for distributed applications. CocoLinks supports Safari and Chrome.

###Installation
The application is ready for use after downloading. Moving the CocoLinks to the dock allows for easy access to different profiles.
