# CocoLinks-CocoSpace-CocoReader

###About CocoLinks
CocoLinks enables the user to save a set of links into the application that can be easily opened later. The app ease of use comes from its ability to open a set of links without having to open a browser and navigate through a bookmark manager. There is also increased privacy due to the self contained nature of the app.

By using this App, the user can free up non-essential webpages, switch tasks, or work on multiple workflows while keeping the number of windows and tabs to a minimum.

CocoLinks comes with the option to choose between browsers, Chrome or Safari, and open links in an existing window or new window.

Additions to the app include a webpage count, next to each set of links, and also a tactical search button. The search button shows all the unique websites currently open in every window. This button is basically a temporary, floating bookmark tab.

###About CocoSpace
CocoReader and CocoLink are free apps that combined together have the same functionality as CocoSpace. CocoSpace makes it easier for developers or users with lots of saved links that need to be saved in different profiles or exported with different bash commands. (The profile name is MSA in the screenshots)

Each set of links can be exported in a file type with the appropriate bash commands. For windows, a .bat file can be exported with bash commands to auto-open the links using bash. A .sh file accomplishes the same task for mac. Finally, a .txt file can be exported with no bash commands.

Another extra feature for CocoSpace are commands to create, delete, and archive profile. These commands allow for links to be more organized in multiple profiles.

The most recent addition to the extra is the "Open PDF File." This button can open a PDF in a browser of the user's choice and in a new window or not.

####Example Usage

The Open, Save, and Delete button correspond to the opening web links from the profile. These buttons operate on the front most window of the “checked” web browser. 

Now, the Search button is less intuitive in that in operates on all the windows. It gets the domain names, such as http://google.com, from all windows. Its pretty useful for searching for a url thats already open, or it can be used as a temporary “floating bookmark” (as in search-> then close out of windows->reopen from search)

On the upper right hand side, the current profile is shown in a drop down menu. New profiles can be created from Extras>Edit Profiles. This becomes useful many saved “link clusters” are in a single profile. 

The Export Links button is mostly for developers who want to export the saved links. I say developers because using the web links in a text format requires some knowledge of bash commands.

Finally, the Open PDF File is pretty useful when downloading multiple PDFs, or when PDF are scattered throughout the file system. Multiple PDFs could be open in a browser and then saved into a profile for ease of access.

###About CocoReader
CocoReader enables the user to view the pdf files in a folder in a list, and then allows the user to open any PDF file in that list with a browser of their choice. 

CocoReader comes with the option to choose between browsers, Chrome or Safari, and open links in an existing window or new window.

###System Requirements
CocoLinks work requires a Macintosh and a Mac OS X version 10.8 or later installed. CocoLinks profiles are located in the app’s container folder as it is required by Apple for distributed applications. CocoLinks supports Safari and Chrome.

###Installation
The application is ready for use after downloading. Moving the CocoLinks to the dock allows for easy access to different profiles.
